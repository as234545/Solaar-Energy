	<h3>How are Solar Panels Protected?</h3>
Solar panels are made of solar cells and encased in durable glass for protection. Beneath the glass there is a layer of
insulation and a protective back sheet.This technology protects against heat and humidity inside the panels to keep your
home solar system running smoothly.Your solar panels also have an anti-reflective coating that allows them to
absorb maximum power from the sun.1

<span id="font_color">Guarding Against Physical Damage to Solar Panels</span>
Your solar array is built to last.  Solar codes and standards are rigorous and the solar industry is committed
to developing cutting-edge technology to make our planet a cleaner place to live.2

A typical solar array lasts 25-30 years, but this doesn’t mean they stop producing electricity. Solar experts report
that panels can continue to work for many decades, provided you take care of them and they aren’t physically damaged.3

There are very few moving parts in a solar system, which means there are very few mechanical parts that could break.
But there are some conditions that could cause physical damage.4

<h3>Common Ways Solar Panels Can Be Damaged:</h3>
<span id="font_color">Twigs, Leaves and Dirt:</span>
Debris can scratch your solar panels and lower the amount of energy produced. Maintain the trees around your home so that branches and
dirt don’t fall on your roof. Clean your solar panels with a garden hose and a soft cloth once a year for maximum efficiency.

<span id="font_color">Hail Storms:</span>
Bad weather is damaging to all roofs, and hailstorms are no exception. Your solar technician should guide you toward the right solar
set up if there is extreme weather in your area.

<span id="font_color">Water Damage:</span>
Your solar panels are sealed just like your windows. Check the sealing just as you would your windows to ensure a water-tight fit.

Sunrun’s System Service Warranty Has You Covered
Most professional solar panel systems come with a 20 year warranty, at the minimum. But many rooftop solar
systems continue to produce electricity even when the warranty ends, which can be upwards of 25-30 years.

That’s why we cover the lifetime of your system with select solar plans and offer a comprehensive 25 years service warranty.
This includes daily monitoring, free maintenance, repairs and comprehensive insurance! These options are only available
to you with select solar plans.
